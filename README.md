# fluid-publish #
A command line tool and node module that can be used to simplify the process of publishing a module to NPM. This is particularly useful for creating development releases, e.g. nightly or continuous integration releases.

By default this will create a release with version __X.x.x-prerelease.yyyymmddThhmmssZ.shortHash__ where __X.x.x__ is sourced from the version number in the package.json file, __-prerelease__ is from the `devTag` option (also applied as a tag to the release), and the __yyyymmddThhmmssZ.shortHash__ build identifier is generated based on the latest commit.

## Installation ##

```bash
# global install
npm install fluid-publish -g

# local dev install
npm install fluid-publish --save-dev
```

## Usage ##

### Command Line API ###

Run these commands from the root directory of the module to be published.

```bash
# creates a dev release (global install)
fluid-publish

# creates a dev release (local install)
./node_modules/.bin/fluid-publish
```

#### --version ####

__value__: true (Boolean)

Returns the current version of the Fluid-Publish module itself. No publishing
steps will occur when this flag is enabled.

```bash
# returns the version of fluid-publish
fluid-publish --version
# fluid-publish 2.0.0
```


#### --standard ####

__value__: true (Boolean)

Specifies that a standard release should be generated. This creates a release named after the version in the package.json file. It will not increase the version number. However, it will create a tag and publish this tag to the version control system.

```bash
# creates a standard release
fluid-publish --standard
```

#### --test ####

__value__: true (Boolean)

Specifies that a tarball should be created instead of publishing to NPM. This is useful to use a means of testing that the publish will happen correctly.

```bash
# creates a tarball
fluid-publish --test
fluid-publish --test --standard

# publishes to NPM
fluid-publish
fluid-publish --standard
```

#### options #####

Optional key/value pairs, in the form `key=value`, to override the default configuration used across the publish script. The defaults can be found in publish.js's [package.json](package.json) file under the `defaultOptions` key.

<em><strong>NOTE</strong>: If only a <code>key</code> is provided, the value is assumed to be <code>true</code></em>

(See: [Options](#options), [process.argv](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv))

```bash
# publishes a dev build and applies the tag "nightly" to it
fluid-publish devTag="nightly"
```

### JavaScript API ###

fluid.publish can also be accessed through standard JavaScript function calls in a  [node](https://nodejs.org) app.


#### `dev` ####

Publishes a development build. This creates a release named after the version, but with the build stamp appended to the end. By default this will create a release with version X.x.x-prerelease.yyyymmddThhmmssZ.shortHash where X.x.x is sourced from the version number in the package.json file, -prerelease is from the `devTag` option (also applied as a tag to the release), and the build identifier (yyyymmddThhmmssZ.shortHash) is generated based on the latest commit.

```javascript
var publish = require("fluid-publish");
publish.dev();
```

##### arguments #####

 1. isTest {Boolean} - Indicates if this is a test run, if true a tarball will be generated instead of publishing to NPM.
 2. options {Object} - The defaults can be found in publish.js's [package.json](package.json) file under the `defaultOptions` key. (See: [Options](#options))

#### `standard` ####

Publishes a release build. This creates a release named after the version in the package.json file. By default it will not increase the version number, this must be done separately. However, it will create a tag and publish this tag to the version control system.

```javascript
var publish = require("fluid-publish");
publish.standard();
```

##### arguments #####

 1. isTest {Boolean} - Indicates if this is a test run, if true a tarball will be generated instead of publishing to NPM.
 2. options {Object} - The defaults can be found in publish.js's [package.json](package.json) file under the `defaultOptions` key. (See: [Options](#options))

## Publishing Itself ##

Publish can publish itself to NPM. This can be done using any of the [usage](#usage) methods described above, or via the NPM `pub` script defined in [package.json](package.json). The script makes use of the command line interface provided to interact with publish.js. However, with NPM you'll need to provide a set of "--" to identify arguments to the script.

```bash
# publishes a dev release to NPM
npm run pub

# publishes a standard release to NPM
npm run pub -- --standard
```
